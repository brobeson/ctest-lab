# CTest Lab

Use VS Code's testing UI to discover, filter, and run tests registered with
CTest.

## Features

The extension does not have any features, yet. This release is to verify the
marketplace appearance.

### Filter by CTest Label

CTest Lab discovers the `LABELS` you add to your tests via CTest properties. In
the test view, you can filter your tests by label. For example, if you label
your unit tests with "unit", you can type `@ctest-lab-tests:unit` to view only
your unit tests.

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your
extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.
